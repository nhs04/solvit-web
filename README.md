# HomePage Design for Solvit project 
I had the opportunity to design the homepage of the **Solvit website**, where I focused on creating a user-friendly and visually appealing interface using modern frontend technologies. 

What I learned: 
- Gained hands-on experience with **React.js** for building dynamic and responsive web pages.
- Improved my skills in using **Material UI** to implement modern and accessible UI components.
- Enhanced my proficiency in **TypeScript**, ensuring clean and maintainable code.
- Strengthened my understanding of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for frontend development.
- Learned to prioritize user experience (UX) and aesthetics in web design.

This project was an incredible learning journey that allowed me to combine technical skills with creativity to deliver impactful results.
